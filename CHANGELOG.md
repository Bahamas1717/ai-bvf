# Changelog

All notable changes to `aibvf-mcp`, `@aibvf/core`, and `aibvf`, in reverse chronological order.

## 0.3.1, in flight

Added: `advisory_next_step` field on Fix and Stop verdicts in `score_initiative` and `recommend_improvements`. Returns a one-line pointer to `craig@craighortonadvisory.com` for the calibration conversation the verdict implies. Accelerate verdicts remain unchanged.

Fixed: version-string drift across `packages/mcp/package.json`, `server.json`, the `Server({ version })` declaration in source, and the startup banner. All four now match.

Added: three-tier engagement section on the public landing page, Verdict Audit, Calibration Programme, Transformation Practice.

## 0.3.0, 14 May 2026

The v0.3 line. Synced major version across `aibvf-mcp` and `@aibvf/core`. Telemetry payload extended to carry `classification` and `confidence` for downstream calibration analysis.

## 0.2.3, 6 May 2026

Fixed: MCP registry publish workflow. Description shortened to 94 characters to meet the registry's 100-character cap.

## 0.2.2, 6 May 2026

Changed: description and keywords expanded for search discoverability on the MCP registry. The package was findable only under "aibvf" or "bvf" before this change.

## 0.2.1, 5 May 2026

Added: telemetry diagnostics banner on startup. The MCP server now prints a clear opt-out path on stderr.

Added: feedback link in the startup banner pointing at GitHub Discussions.

Added: provenance attestation on the npm publish workflow.

Fixed: telemetry POST not firing due to schema mismatch on the Supabase target table. Migration `20260422_mcp_calls_add_classification.sql` was missing from production. Re-aligned, telemetry now lands cleanly.

Fixed: auto-unlock BVF gate from URL parameter on the public protocol page.

## 0.2.0, 5 May 2026

First feature-complete release. Six tools on stdio:

- `score_initiative`
- `recommend_improvements`
- `calculate_pace_layer_drag`
- `validate_portfolio`
- `get_benchmark`
- `list_taxonomy`

Anonymous telemetry with opt-out via `AIBVF_TELEMETRY_DISABLE=1`. Deterministic four-pillar scoring against published benchmark ranges. Schema validation against AI BVF v1.0.

Industry modules included: healthcare clinical validation, financial services capture multipliers, cross-industry readiness capture rates from EY/Oxford, Prosci change-success calibration, Pace Layer drag calculation.

## 0.1.0 to 0.1.4, April 2026

Initial protocol drafts, registry plumbing, and pre-feature-complete iterations.
